Integrated Security Tool (45-Day Milestone)
Purpose
The goal of this project is to integrate my two previous tools into a single workflow. It serves as a practical conclusion to my first 45 days of learning Python for cybersecurity.  
By building this "Main Dashboard," I connected:
SentinelPass: A tool for calculating password entropy and strength.  
NetAudit-Lite: A multi-threaded port scanner for network analysis.  
Technical Integration
This project focuses on Code Organization (Modularity). Instead of running scripts separately, I used Python imports to call specific functions from my existing projects. This approach helped me understand how to build a unified security interface.  
Environmental Challenges (Technical Impact)
Developing these tools in Yemen presented specific technical hurdles:
Power Constraints: Limited electricity required optimizing my coding sessions and working offline frequently.  
Network Instability: Testing the NetAudit-Lite scanner was difficult due to slow internet speeds and high latency, which required adding better timeout handling in the code.  
Resource Access: Downloading documentation and security libraries was often interrupted by connection drops.
Summary of Learning
Security Logic: Applied mathematical entropy to passwords.  
Networking: Handled raw sockets and multi-threading for faster scans.  
Management: Organized multiple files into one functional toolkit.
